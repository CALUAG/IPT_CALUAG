            <h3>Here's a brief description about me <h3><br>
                <p>I am a 22-year-old Information Technology student at the City of Malabon University, passionate about technology and continuous learning. In addition to my academic interests, I enjoy exploring various aspects of tech, such as coding, web development, and gaming. I spend my free time experimenting with personal coding projects, learning new programming languages, and staying up-to-date with tech trends.

                    Outside of tech, I love playing basketball with friends, exploring local caf√©s, and attending tech meetups to connect with like-minded individuals. I also have a keen interest in photography, capturing moments from my travels and daily life. My hobbies help me stay creative and inspired, and I aim to incorporate these diverse interests into my future career in IT.</p>
